This book/blog was written using Emacs org-mode, org-ref, Zotero and
pandoc, running on Mac OSX. In addition, artwork was produced using
Inkscape and GIMP. I am grateful to the community of developers who
produce and maintain these outstanding free tools.\
The web pages were designed, using the Ruby-based static web site
generator Jekyll, based on the [Basically Basic Jekyll
Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) by
*mmistakes* (Michael Rose). I would like to also acknowledge
[Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) for part of the header graphics shown on
the web pages. The header graphics for the web pages in the \"Code\"
section are excerpts from the *Maya Madrid Codex* (for more info on this
see, for example, [Madrid
Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Codex))
