This is a book/blog site discussing Do-It-Yourself approaches to animal tracking in the research lab. Much of the materials and procedures described here are the result of the experience accumulated over the years by myself and present and past members of our research group(s).<br />
In particular I would like to acknowledge the contributions of: Aram Megighian, Giovanni Frighetto, Nicola Meda, Giulio Menti, Marco Dal Maschio, Matteo Bruzzone. <br />
