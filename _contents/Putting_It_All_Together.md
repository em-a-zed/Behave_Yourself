<!--- # General concepts --->

# The following are a couple of schematized tracking setups
In the first case the setup consists in a cylindrical LED panel enclosure at the bottom of which there is a circular 3D-printed transparent-resin arena with a transparent glass top. The arena is illuminated from beneath with an array of Infrared LEDs, while the tracked individual (in this case a fly) is video-recorded using a digital camera equipped with a longpass IR filter. Visual stimulation of the individual occurs via programmed patterns transmitted by the computer software to the arrays of LEDs.

In the second case the setup consists in a cylindrical frosted (sanded) plexiglass enclosure at the bottom of which there is a circular 3D-printed transparent-resin arena with a transparent glass top. The arena is illuminated from beneath with an array of Infrared LEDs, while the tracked individual (in this case a fly) is video-recorded using a digital camera equipped with a longpass IR filter. Visual stimulation of the individual occurs via programmed patterns transmitted in a coordinated way by the computer software to the pair of UST projectors which project onto opposite sides of the curved surface of the frosted plexiglass cylinder.

# Placing and connecting the components

In general, components of setups, such as those described in the
preceding section, should be ideally placed in a light-tight enclosure
or in a dark room in order to ensure that the animals do not receive any
undesired visual signals. This is true both for conditions which
envisage visual stimulation (via LED panels or via projectors) as well
as for experimental conditions which do not contemplate any specific
visual stimulation.\
Apart from this, the required components should ideally be placed on a
relatively stable (possibly vibration free) surface/bench. Often,
alluminium black breadboard surfaces (i.e. see the section dealing with
*optomechanics*) can be extremely useful because they provide handy ways
with which to sturdily fix camera and/or projector holders, through the
use of alluminium posts and clamps. For a very basic example of this see
the figure below:

The figure shows a wide field view of the whole setup. The UST projector
is circled in red, while the video camera above the
frosted-surface-plexiglass cylinder is circled in green. These two parts
are shown as enlargements in the following two figures.\
The first image shows the UST projector placed upon a metal plate, which
is fixed, through small mounting posts screwed onto a large alluminium
breadboard base.

The second image shows the frosted-surface-plexiglass cylinder, with
above it the videocamera connected to an \"overhead camera platform\"
(from [Glidegear](https://glidegear.net/)). The plexiglass cylinder sits
on top of a custom made transparent plexiglass \"table\" and surrounds a
circular arena (not visible) which also sits on the plexiglass platform.
Immediately below the plexiglass platform is a glass mirror placed at a
45 degree angle with respect to the horizontal. The mirror reflects
infrared light upward through the plexiglass table to the video camera
above. Thge IR light is projected from a circular array of IR LEDs,
placed to the right of the image (in front of the mirror), and fixed to
a mini alluminium breadboard with a specific holder.
