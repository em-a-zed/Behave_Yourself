<!--- # General concepts --->


The possibility of writing your own software to suit contingent requirements admittedly requires the acquisition of the necessary programming skills. However, if one has a
sufficiently simple blueprint of a working version to follow, then the task becomes much more accessible, even to those with little previous programming experience.   
The scope of this section is to provide the user with re-usable code, which can work more or less \"out of the box\", but which can also be easily customized to suit one's own needs. <br />The proposed code is stuff we currently employ in our own labs. The focus of these scripts is on functionality, with little or no attention to designing a proper user-friendly GUI, just the bare essentials. The advantage of such an approach rests in the fact that the software retains a relatively simple structure, is highly flexible (i.e. it can be updated and modified at any time). Furthermore, there is little or no danger of ending up with a version of the software which has been abandoned by the developer and as a consequence can become out of date with respect to the underlying computer's operating system.<br />
Commercial software packages, apart from being relatively expensive (some times very much so) are relatively safe from this type of issue, but may require the payment of further fees for the updates. This is not to say that commercial software has no reason to be expensive. Particularly in cases in which the sofware is very specialized and tailors the needs of a relatively small user base (as is the case in question), the costs of development and production are more difficult to cover, than would be the case for a software package which has a wider scope (i.e. word processors, spreadsheets) and also a much wider user base.
