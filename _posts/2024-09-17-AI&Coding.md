Since part of this blog deals with writing custom code to perform
tracking and/or stimulation, I suppose that given the times we live
in, it makes sense to wonder whether (human) software coding skills
are still a requisite, given the advent and widespread availability
of the currently available Large Language Module (LLM)-based models
of artificial intelligence (AI).

AI has the potential to play an important role in writing computer
software, and its impact is growing rapidly.  
  
*Spoiler alert*: At the present state of the art humans still do play
an indispensable role in the conception and writing of software,
albeit AI is playing an increasingly important collaborative role in
the process.  


# The following are some of the ways in which AI is shaping the field of software development:

-   AI can handle repetitive, routine coding tasks by generating
    boilerplate code, unit tests, and even documentation. This enables
    developers to concentrate on more complex, creative work, thereby
    boosting productivity.
-   Tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI’s Codex support developers by
    offering code suggestions, auto-completing lines, and assisting in
    debugging. AI serves as a valuable assistant, minimizing common
    mistakes and enhancing code quality by promoting best practices.
-   AI is transforming software testing by generating test cases,
    identifying edge cases, and predicting potential software
    failures. This improves code reliability and reduces the time spent
    on manual testing.
-   AI can review existing code to detect inefficiencies and suggest
    improvements in performance, memory use, or scalability. This is
    especially useful for optimizing large, complex systems where manual
    analysis would be time-consuming and prone to errors.
-   AI systems capable of understanding natural language, like GPT-4,
    are closing the gap between human ideas and programming. Users can
    describe their goals in plain English, and AI can generate
    functional code, making programming more accessible to those without
    expert-level skills.
-   By analyzing vast codebases, AI learns patterns, common frameworks,
    and best practices. This knowledge allows it to suggest
    enhancements, generate code, and even create software architectures
    that align with modern trends and innovations.
-   AI plays a key role in low-code and no-code platforms, empowering
    users with minimal programming knowledge to develop applications
    through user-friendly interfaces. This democratizes software
    development and reduces entry barriers.
-   In the future, AI may go beyond coding assistance to contribute to
    high-level architectural decisions. By assessing project
    requirements, AI could propose system designs, recommend design
    patterns, and select the best technologies.
-   AI can act as a collaborative tool within development teams by
    facilitating knowledge sharing. It might suggest code snippets from
    other parts of a company’s codebase or flag outdated techniques
    based on collective team experiences.


# While AI is a powerful tool in software development, there are still challenges:

-   AI often struggles with understanding the broader context of a
    project or problem, which limits its ability to write complex
    systems from scratch.
-   There are concerns about job displacement for developers, especially
    junior-level roles, and the ethical use of AI in sensitive systems.
-   AI models can generate incorrect or biased code if trained on
    problematic data. This can lead to vulnerabilities or inefficiencies
    in the software.

  
AI is increasingly becoming an essential tool for developers, enabling
them to work more efficiently, with fewer mistakes, and on more
cutting-edge projects. However, human oversight is still needed for
intricate design decisions and ethical concerns. While AI’s role will
likely grow in the future, human creativity and problem-solving will
continue to be key elements in the development process.
