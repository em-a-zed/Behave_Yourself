In most of the tasks requiring computer-to-apparatus or apparatus-to-computer communication we have used Arduino technology and/or LabJack interfaces (see "*What you will (or might) need: hardware*" in the *Contents* section).
These work through a USB connection with the computer and a direct connection through the I/O ports of the device (Arduino/LabJack) with the external device to control, or from which to receive, data/signals.

An interesting addition to the above, consists in the ESP32 family of microcontrollers, which also allow wireless connectivity, in addition to a small size factor and low energy consumption.
<br /> 
The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller unit (MCU) developed by [Espressif Systems](https://www.espressif.com/), widely recognized for its rich feature set and excellent performance, particularly in Internet of Things (IoT) applications.  
<br />
The main features of the ESP32 are:

1. **Dual-core Processor**:
   - The ESP32 features a dual-core Tensilica Xtensa LX6 microprocessor, which can run at up to 240 MHz. It has two cores (Core 0 and Core 1), allowing for multitasking and parallel processing.

2. **Memory**:
   - The ESP32 typically has 520 KB of SRAM and 448 KB of ROM, along with 16 KB of RTC SRAM. Some variants also come with external flash and PSRAM for additional memory.

3. **Wireless Connectivity**:
   - **Wi-Fi**: The ESP32 includes 802.11 b/g/n/e/i Wi-Fi, making it ideal for wireless communication.
   - **Bluetooth**: It supports both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing it to connect to a wide range of Bluetooth devices.

4. **Peripheral Interfaces**:
   - The ESP32 has a wide range of peripheral interfaces, including UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, CAN, PWM, ADC, DAC, and touch sensors.
   - It also supports SD card interface, Ethernet, and camera interface (DVP).

5. **Low Power Consumption**:
   - The ESP32 is designed with multiple power modes to optimize energy consumption, including light sleep, deep sleep, and hibernation modes. This makes it suitable for battery-powered applications.

6. **Security**:
   - The MCU includes hardware encryption, secure boot, and flash encryption features to enhance security for IoT devices.

7. **Operating System**:
   - The ESP32 supports the FreeRTOS operating system, providing a real-time environment for running multiple tasks simultaneously. It also has an integrated TCP/IP stack.

8. **Development Environment**:
   - The ESP32 is widely supported by development environments such as the Arduino IDE, Espressif's own ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), and PlatformIO.
   - It also has support for Python (MicroPython) and JavaScript (Espruino), making it accessible to developers with different skill sets.

9. **Variants**:
   - There are multiple variants of the ESP32, including ESP32-WROOM, ESP32-WROVER, and ESP32-S2/S3. Each variant may have different features, such as additional memory, camera support, or enhanced security.  
<br />
The ESP32 has a strong community of developers, extensive documentation, and a large number of third-party libraries and resources, making it one of the most popular MCUs for IoT and embedded systems development.
