<!--- # The logic of the basic experimental setups --->

<p>There are two basic scenarios which normally present themselves:</p>
<h2 id="sec:org305ea2a">Tracking of freely moving animals in the absence
of specific visual stimulation</h2>
<p>In this context, there are different possibilities:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Single animal in a single arena</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple animals in a single arena</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple animals, each in a single arena<br />
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Given that tracking of the animals occurs in the absence of visual
stimulation, it follows that illumination of the arenas need not be done
with infrared light. Consequently video recording of the behaviour of
the animal(s) can be performed with ordinary optics (i.e. no special
light filters are required). Illumination is best done from beneath the
arena, while the video camera records the backlit scene from above. In
the first case, the software of choice for tracking could be <a
href="https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo">MARGO</a>, if one is
interested in live-tracking of the animal. If on the other hand,
live-tracking is not important, then <a
href="https://ctrax.sourceforge.net/">Ctrax</a> can be used for offline
tracking.<br />
In the case of multiple animals, if one is interested in maintaining the
identity of the individuals distinct throughout the tracking process,
then Ctrax would be the tracking software of choice, albeit that the
tracking can only be performed offline. If, on the other hand, it is not
important to keep the identity of the animals separate during the
tracking, i.e. in the case one is only interested in knowing the total
amount of movement (the total or the average distance travelled
collectively by all the animals) during the tracking period, then the
MARGO package can be used to perform live-tracking of the multiple
animals.</p>
<h2 id="sec:org5d65a3b">Tracking of freely moving animals in the
presence of specific visual stimulation</h2>
<p>In this context it is more customary to track animals under one of
the following two conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Single animal in a single arena</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple animals, each in a single arena<br />
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In this case, the reason why the condition with "multiple animals in
a single arena" is not considered is that in this type of setup the
individuals are under the influence of one another, since they share the
same arena. This would introduce a source of (possibly unwanted)
disturbance, in particlar if the objective of the setup is to evaluate
the response of the animals specifically to the visual stimuli.<br />
In both cases, the software of choice for tracking is <a
href="https://github.com/de-Bivort-Lab/margo">MARGO</a>, especially if
one is interested in live-tracking of the individuals. <a
href="https://ctrax.sourceforge.net/">Ctrax</a> could also be used in
these cases, albeit the tracking can only be performed offline.<br />
Within the context of tracking animals subjected to specific visual
stimulation, we can consider two different experimental paradigms.
Open-loop or closed-loop visual stimulation.<br />
</p>
<h3 id="sec:org2e52792">Open-loop conditions</h3>
<p>Under open-loop conditions, the animals are subjected to visual
stimuli, which can be provided by computer-controlled Light Emitting
Diode (LED) panels or by Ultra Short Throw (UST) projector(s). In
open-loop conditions, the tracked behavioural response of the animals
has no effect on the visual stimuli.</p>
<h3 id="sec:orgc9b3a97">Closed-loop conditions</h3>
<p>Under closed-loop conditions the animals are subjected to visual
stimuli, which can be provided by computer-controlled LED panels or by
UST projector(s). In this case the tracked behavioural response of the
animals can affect the visual stimuli: The way in which the behavioural
response of the animals affects the visual stimuli is determined by
programming the software which controls the visual stimuli to respond in
predetermined ways to specific behavioural parameters. The behavioural
parameters are obtained through live-tracking of the animalâ€™s
movements.</p>
