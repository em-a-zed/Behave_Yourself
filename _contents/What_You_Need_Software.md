## Specific Software

1.  **Tracking software**

    1.  <span class="underline">**Ctrax: The Caltech Multiple Walking Fly Tracker**</span>
              
        Live (real time) unsupervised tracking of multiple moving objects
        contained in a single defined area of interest is a relatively complex
        task. In particular it is a task which requires supervision and a
        large amount of computing power, making it at best a slow
        process. Consequently, closed loop experiments based on the response
        to the tracked behaviour of multiple animals contained in a single
        delimited arena is not really feasible given the above mentioned
        difficulties.
        
        On the other hand, software packages such as Ctrax are specifically
        designed to efficiently perform offline supervised tracking of
        multiple animals contained in a single delimited arena. In this case
        operator supervision is necessary to aid in correcting small tracking
        errors.
        
        Ctrax is a freely available, cross-platform, open source standalone
        software package.
        <br />
        This is the link to the Ctrax software download and documentation
        pages: [Ctrax](https://ctrax.sourceforge.net).
    
    2.  <span class="underline">**MARGO: Massively Automated Real-time GUI for Object-tracking**</span>
              
        MARGO is scripted in the MATLAB programming environment. The
        GUI-based application allows to simultaneously track (in real time) up
        to several hundred individuals, each contained within a delimited
        arena. As an example, in the case of Drosophila this would typically
        be done with individual flies housed within the wells of 48 or 96-well
        flat-bottomed cell culture plates.
        
        Interestingly, this type of setup **does** allow for closed-loop
        experiments involving multiple animals. This is because simultaneous
        real time tracking of even hundreds of individuals is possible when
        the single individuals are confined to "private" non-overlapping
        arenas.
        
        In fact the main issue with tracking many animals within the same arena
        boils down to the computer intensiveness of the algorithms designed to
        resolve trajectories of animals whose paths cross during the tracking
        period. The task becomes a lot less computer-intensive if it is not
        necessary to keep the identity of the individuals separate during the
        tracking. Thus MARGO also allows to (live-) track multiple individuals
        housed in a single arena, albeit without keeping the identity of the
        individuals separate.

        PsychoPyÂ® is a very powerful open-source package for running
        experiments in Python (a real and free alternative to
        Matlab). PsychoPyÂ® combines the graphical strengths of OpenGL with
        simple Python syntax to give scientists a free and simple stimulus
        presentation and control package. It is used by many labs worldwide
        for psychophysics, cognitive neuroscience and experimental
        psychology.
