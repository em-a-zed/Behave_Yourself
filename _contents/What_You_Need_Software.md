<h3 id="sec:orgddaf80c">Specific Software</h3>
<p>In recent years many software packages for tracking of animals in
laboratory settings have been proposed by the researcher community. Some
of them are specifically dedicated to tracking offline from video
recordings of the animal(s) activity. Others are designed to perform
relatively high speed real-time tracking (usually of single animals). In
what follows I describe those packages which have been, to some extent,
employed in our labs.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Tracking software</strong> <span id="sec:orgf3302c3"
label="sec:orgf3302c3"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Ctrax: The Caltech Multiple Walking Fly Tracker</strong>
<span id="sec:orga25b385" label="sec:orga25b385"></span> Live (real
time) unsupervised tracking of multiple moving objects contained in a
single defined area of interest is a relatively complex task. In
particular it is a task which requires supervision and a large amount of
computing power, making it at best a slow process. Consequently, closed
loop experiments based on the response to the tracked behaviour of
multiple animals contained in a single delimited arena is not really
feasible given the above mentioned difficulties.</p>
<p>On the other hand, software packages such as Ctrax are specifically
designed to efficiently perform offline supervised tracking of multiple
animals contained in a single delimited arena. In this case operator
supervision is necessary to aid in correcting small tracking errors.</p>
<p>Ctrax is a freely available, cross-platform, open source standalone
software package.</p>
<p>This is the link to the Ctrax software download and documentation
pages: <a href="https://ctrax.sourceforge.net">Ctrax</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MARGO: Massively Automated Real-time GUI for
Object-tracking</strong> <span id="sec:org8b3597e"
label="sec:org8b3597e"></span> MARGO is scripted in the MATLAB
programming environment. The GUI-based application allows to
simultaneously track (in real time) up to several hundred individuals,
each contained within a delimited arena. As an example, in the case of
Drosophila this would typically be done with individual flies housed
within the wells of 48 or 96-well flat-bottomed cell culture plates.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this type of setup <strong>does</strong> allow for
closed-loop experiments involving multiple animals. This is because
simultaneous real time tracking of even hundreds of individuals is
possible when the single individuals are confined to "private"
non-overlapping arenas.</p>
<p>In fact the main issue with tracking many animals within the same
arena boils down to the computer intensiveness of the algorithms
designed to resolve trajectories of animals whose paths cross during the
tracking period. The task becomes a lot less computer-intensive if it is
not necessary to keep the identity of the individuals separate during
the tracking. Thus MARGO also allows to (live-) track multiple
individuals housed in a single arena, albeit without keeping the
identity of the individuals separate.</p>

tools. Ethoscopes are simple to construct using 3D printing technology
and can be powered by Raspberry Pi microcomputers and Arduino boards,
making the hardware both affordable and flexible. Full software and
construction details can be found at the <a
