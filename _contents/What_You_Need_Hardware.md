### Electronics

1.  <span class="underline">Arduino</span>

      
    Arduino electronic boards are open-source hardware platforms designed
    for creating digital devices and interactive objects that can sense
    and control physical elements. They are popular for their ease of use,
    versatility, and wide range of applications in electronics
    projects. Here are some key characteristics:
    
    1.  ****Microcontroller-Based****: Each Arduino board comes with a
        microcontroller (e.g., ATmega328 on the Arduino Uno), which acts as
        the brain of the board, executing programmed instructions.
    2.  ****Digital and Analog I/O Pins****: Arduino boards have multiple input
        and output pins that can be used to connect sensors, LEDs, motors,
        and other electronic components.
    3.  ****Programming Environment****: Arduino uses a simplified version of
        C/C++ and comes with an integrated development environment (IDE)
        that is user-friendly and easy to learn.
    4.  ****USB Connectivity****: Most boards can be connected to a computer
        via USB for programming and power supply.
    5.  ****Wide Compatibility****: Arduino is compatible with a vast array of
        sensors, modules, and shields that extend its functionality.
    
    Some typical applications for Arduino boards:
    
    -   ****Prototyping****: Rapid development of electronic prototypes.
    -   ****Education****: Teaching electronics and programming.
    -   ****Robotics****: Controlling robots and automation systems.
    -   ****IoT****: Creating Internet of Things devices that can communicate
        over networks.
    -   ****DIY Projects****: Building personal projects, such as home
        automation systems, wearable technology, and interactive art.
    
    Other important points of strength of the Arduino project are:
    
    -   ****Open Source****: The hardware and software are open-source, allowing
        for customization and community contributions.
    -   ****Extensive Documentation****: A wealth of tutorials, forums, and
        examples are available online.
    -   ****Libraries****: Numerous libraries are available to simplify the use
        of various sensors and modules.

2.  <span class="underline">LED Panels</span>

      
    LED-based panels can efficiently be employed to present visual
    stimuli to model organisms. In 2008, Michael Reiser and Michael
    Dickinson (\cite{reiser_modular_2008}) reported the design of an
    approximately cylindrical modular display system for insect
    behavioral neuroscience. Following that report, the design was
    further updated, and all the technical details for the
    construction of such modular systems were made publicly available
    through the author's Github website [Modular-LED-Display](https://reiserlab.github.io/Modular-LED-Display/). The
    website documents everything required to implement a fully
    functional system, including commercial sources for the LED
    panels, the electronics, the hardware and the software required
    to control them. As of writing, the LED panels used are
    monochromatic (i.e. green LEDs), however this also results in
    very high speed refresh rates (up to 500Hz, with 256 brightness
    levels).

3.  <span class="underline">Ultra-Short-Throw Digital Projectors</span>

      
    UST projectors refer to "Ultra Short Throw" projectors. These are
    specialized projectors designed to project large images from a
    very short distance to the screen or wall. In general, UST
    projectors can project large images(e.g., 250cm, diagonal, or
    more) from just a few centimeters away from the screen or the
    surface on which to project the image. This is achieved through
    advanced lens and mirror systems. Nowdays, such projectors are
    widely available on the consumer market at relatively affordable
    prices, depending on the required quality of the projected image
    (i.e. resolution, brightness and contrast). However, the
    applications envisaged in the specific context being considered
    here, require the projection of high definition, high contrast
    images, having sizes in the range of 25cm (diagonal). The type of
    projectors that have such characteristics are those designed for
    applications requiring the short distance projection of
    relatively small images which can function as user interfaces
    (i.e. touch screen functions on common surfaces, such as walls or
    panels of any material, including glass).  
    Currently we are using projectors from [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com/) (Texas
    Instruments, DLP LightCrafter™ Display 4710 EVM Gen2).

4.  <span class="underline">Digital Cameras</span>

      
    When selecting video cameras for video tracking applications,
    certain characteristics are particularly desirable to ensure
    accurate and efficient tracking performance. Here are some key
    attributes to consider:
    
    1.  ****High Frame Rate****:
    2.  High frame rates (60 fps or higher) are essential for capturing
        smooth motion, which is crucial for accurately tracking fast-moving
        objects.
    
    3.  ****High Resolution****:
    4.  High resolution allows for more detailed images, which can improve
        the accuracy of the tracking system.
    
    5.  ****Low Latency****:
    6.  Low latency ensures that the video feed is processed in real-time,
        which is critical for responsive tracking.
    
    7.  ****Global Shutter****:
    8.  Global shutters capture the entire frame at once, as opposed to
        rolling shutters which capture the frame line by line.
    
    9.  ****High Dynamic Range (HDR)****:
    10. HDR capability allows the camera to capture details in both very
        bright and very dark areas of the scene.
    
    11. ****Good Low-Light Performance****:
    12. Many tracking applications may occur in low-light or variable
        lighting conditions.
    
    13. ****Robust Connectivity****:
    14. Fast and reliable data transfer is essential for high-performance
        tracking.
    
    15. ****Software and SDK Support****:
    16. Comprehensive software support ensures that the camera can be easily
        integrated into existing systems.
    
    Example Cameras for Video Tracking:
    
    -   ****FLIR Blackfly S****: Known for high frame rates, global shutter, and
        high resolution.
    -   ****Basler ace****: Offers a range of resolutions and frame rates, and
        is compact and lightweight.
    -   ****XIMEA xiQ Series****: Compact design with high frame rates and low
        latency, ideal for embedded systems.
    
    Selecting the right video camera for tracking depends on the specific
    requirements of your application, such as the speed of the objects
    being tracked, lighting conditions, and integration needs.

### Arenas

The design and construction of arenas suitable for containing the
animals in a defined space during tracking (perhaps in the
presence of visual stimulation of the individuals) requires the
consideration of some key aspects such as:  

-   the material used to construct the arena should be transparent,
    in particular the top, which is the part through which the video
    camera will be recording the behaviour of the enclosed animals;
-   the shape of the arena should be considered carefully, according
    to the intentions of the experimenter. In particular, circular
    shaped arenas are generally used in order to avoid having
    corners into which the animals may tend to find "refuge", which
    may result in the animals remaining immobile for most of the
    experiment time. On the other hand, circular open spaces may be
    a source of stress, and this should be kept in due
    consideration. In this respect, throughout the years, many other
    geometries for arenas used to study particular aspects of
    *Drosophila melanogaster* behaviour have been proposed (see for
    example, \cite{soibam_modeling_2012} or
    \cite{tom_mekdara_novel_2012}).
-   In the case of experiments involving insects, such as
    Drosophila, the height of the enclosing arena (i.e. floor to
    ceiling) requires a careful design in order to restrict the
    vertical motion of the flies by not allowing them to fly, but
    only walk. Also the height should decline towards the edges of
    the arena, so that the flies can only adopt an upright standing
    position throughout the arena, as described in the paper by
    Simon et al. (\cite{simon_new_2010}).
