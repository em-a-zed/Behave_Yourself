# The following are a couple of schematized tracking setups
In the first case the setup consists in a cylindrical LED panel enclosure at the bottom of which there is a circular 3D-printed transparent-resin arena with a transparent glass top. The arena is illuminated from beneath with an array of Infrared LEDs, while the tracked individual (in this case a fly) is video-recorded using a digital camera equipped with a longpass IR filter. Visual stimulation of the individual occurs via programmed patterns transmitted by the computer software to the arrays of LEDs.

In the second case the setup consists in a cylindrical frosted (sanded) plexiglass enclosure at the bottom of which there is a circular 3D-printed transparent-resin arena with a transparent glass top. The arena is illuminated from beneath with an array of Infrared LEDs, while the tracked individual (in this case a fly) is video-recorded using a digital camera equipped with a longpass IR filter. Visual stimulation of the individual occurs via programmed patterns transmitted in a coordinated way by the computer software to the pair of UST projectors which project onto opposite sides of the curved surface of the frosted plexiglass cylinder.
